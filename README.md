# Pre-trained-ANN-to-SNN-conversion
This project demonstrates the conversion of pre-trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) into Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in Google Colab. By leveraging SNNs' energy efficiency and real-time processing, it offers a potential paradigm shift in resource-efficient computing for applications like edge AI and robotics.
